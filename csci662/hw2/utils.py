### Rough guidelines --- typos
# For typos, you can try to simulate nearest keys on the QWERTY keyboard for some of the letter (e.g. vowels)
# You can randomly select each word with some fixed probability, and replace random letters in that word with one of the
# nearest keys on the keyboard. You can vary the random probablity or which letters to use to achieve the desired accuracy.


### Rough guidelines --- synonym replacement
# For synonyms, use can rely on wordnet (already imported here). Wordnet (https://www.nltk.org/howto/wordnet.html) includes
# something called synsets (which stands for synonymous words) and for each of them, lemmas() should give you a possible synonym word.
# You can randomly select each word with some fixed probability to replace by a synonym.

    # You are free to implement any transformation but the comments at the top roughly describe
    # how you could implement two of them --- synonym replacement and typos.

    # You should update each item in examples["text"] using your transformation, as is done in the example above
